                  d. Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, although You are able to
                  change Your browser settings to control cookies, including whether or not You

               <p>5. HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS STORED</p>
               <p>
                  a. Please note that no systems involving the transmission of information via the
                  internet, or the electronic storage of data, are completely secure. However, we
                  take the protection and storage of Your Personal Information very seriously. We
                  take all reasonable steps to protect Your Personal Information.
               </p>
               <p class="mb-20">
                  b. We use appropriate physical, digital, managerial and security systems to store
                  Your Personal Information and to protect it against unauthorised access,
                  destruction or disclosure.
               </p>
               <p>6. THIRD PARTIES</p>
               <p>
                  a. We may provide some of Your Personal Information from time to time to Third
                  Party Service Providers so that they can help us to serve You via the Product. In
                  particular, We may use Third Party Service Providers to assist with information
                  storage (such as cloud storage).
               </p>
               <p>
                  b. We may provide some of Your Personal Information to Third Party Service
                  Providers for the purpose of analysing data or tracking usage. For example, We may
                  use these services to find out where page requests come from, dates and times of
                  page requests, details of any website that referred You to the Product and other
                  details about Your usage of the Product. This information enables Us to understand
                  patterns of usage of the Product, and to improve the Product.
               </p>
               <p>
                  c. We may use Third Party Service Providers to host the Product. If this occurs,
                  that Third Party Service Provider is likely to have access to some of Your
                  Personal Information.
               </p>
               <p>
                  d. We may use Third Party Service Providers to fulfil orders in relation to the
                  Product.
               </p>
               <p>
                  e. For Your information, some of Our Third Party Service Providers may be located
                  outside Australia and may not be subject to Australian privacy laws. The countries
                  or regions in which our Third Party Service Providers may be located include:
                  ________
               </p>
               <p>
                  f. However, We only share Your Personal Information with a Third Party Service
                  Provider if that provider agrees to Our privacy standards as set out in this
                  Privacy Policy.
               </p>
               <p>
                  g. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Privacy Policy, We may provide
                  Your Personal Information to a third party or to third parties in order to protect
                  the rights, property or safety, of Us, Our customers or third parties, or as
                  otherwise required by law.
               </p>
               <p>
                  h. We will not knowingly share Your Personal Information with any third parties
                  other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
               </p>
               <p class="mb-20">
                  i. If Your Personal Information might be provided to a third party in a manner
                  which is other than as explained in this Privacy Policy, You will be notified. You
                  will also have the opportunity to request Us not to share that information.

               <p>16. COMPLAINTS</p>
               <p>
                  a. We take customer satisfaction very seriously. If You have a complaint in
                  relation to Our handling of Your Personal Information, We will endeavour to handle
                  it promptly and fairly. For Your information, an overview of Our complaints
                  handling procedure is as follows:
               </p>
               <p>
                  I. Any complaints are forwarded to Our complaints officer for review. We aim to
                  review all complaints within 7 days of receiving them (although this cannot be
                  guaranteed). If necessary, the complaints officer may then refer the complaint to
                  another section within Our organisation for consideration. If further information
                  is required, We may contact You to request that information. If We accept fault in
                  relation to the complaint then We will propose a resolution (which may or may not
                  be the same as any resolution proposed by You). If We do not accept fault, then We
                  will contact You to advise You of this. We aim to complete this entire process
                  within 21 days, provided that We are provided complete information in the first
                  place (although this cannot be guaranteed). However, if You do not provide
                  complete information then this is likely to delay the handling of Your complaint.
               </p>
               <p>
                  II. All complaints should be provided in writing either by email or regular mail,
                  using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Describe the nature
                  of your complaint including any relevant dates, people involved, any consequences
                  that have occurred, and what you believe should be done to rectify the issue. We
                  will endeavour to respond within 21 days, although we cannot guarantee this.
               </p>
               <p class="mb-20">
                  III. If You are not satisfied with Our response to Your complaint, You may refer
                  your complaint to the relevant external dispute resolution organisation in Your
                  area.
