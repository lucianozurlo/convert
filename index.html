                  a. We may provide some of Your Personal Information from time to time to Third
                  Party Service Providers so that they can help us to serve You via the Product. In

                  b. We may provide some of Your Personal Information to Third Party Service
                  Providers for the purpose of analysing data or tracking usage. For example, We may

                  page requests, details of any website that referred You to the Product and other
                  details about Your usage of the Product. This information enables Us to understand
                  patterns of usage of the Product, and to improve the Product.
               </p>
               <p>
                  c. We may use Third Party Service Providers to host the Product. If this occurs,
                  that Third Party Service Provider is likely to have access to some of Your
                  Personal Information.
               </p>
               <p>

                  e. For Your information, some of Our Third Party Service Providers may be located

                  Provider if that provider agrees to Our privacy standards as set out in this
                  Privacy Policy.
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  h. We will not knowingly share Your Personal Information with any third parties
                  other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
               </p>
               <p class="mb-20">

               <p>
                  a. We take customer satisfaction very seriously. If You have a complaint in
                  relation to Our handling of Your Personal Information, We will endeavour to handle
                  it promptly and fairly. For Your information, an overview of Our complaints
                  handling procedure is as follows:
               </p>
               <p>
                  I. Any complaints are forwarded to Our complaints officer for review. We aim to
                  review all complaints within 7 days of receiving them (although this cannot be
                  guaranteed). If necessary, the complaints officer may then refer the complaint to
                  another section within Our organisation for consideration. If further information
                  is required, We may contact You to request that information. If We accept fault in
                  relation to the complaint then We will propose a resolution (which may or may not
                  be the same as any resolution proposed by You). If We do not accept fault, then We
                  will contact You to advise You of this. We aim to complete this entire process
                  within 21 days, provided that We are provided complete information in the first
                  place (although this cannot be guaranteed). However, if You do not provide
                  complete information then this is likely to delay the handling of Your complaint.
               </p>
               <p>
                  II. All complaints should be provided in writing either by email or regular mail,
                  using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Describe the nature
                  of your complaint including any relevant dates, people involved, any consequences
                  that have occurred, and what you believe should be done to rectify the issue. We
                  will endeavour to respond within 21 days, although we cannot guarantee this.
